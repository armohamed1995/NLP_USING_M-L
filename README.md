Natural Language Processing with Python for Machine Learning Essential Training. I'm A R Mohammed. I'm a  data scientist (Intern) with a passion for natural language processing. 

# In this repository , I will cover some basics of natural language processing like reading in and creating structure in messy text data, and then cleaning and tokenizing that data. 

Then I have used some of the more advanced topics like lemmatizing, stemming, and vectorizing your data. 
# In other words, converting it from text into a numeric matrix. 

my initial focus is on preparing the data to build a machine learning classifier on top of it. 
I have used two different types of machine learning models, while thoroughly testing and evaluating different variations of those models. 

You can use my scripts as tools to go from messy dataset to concise and accurate predictions from machine learning model, to deliver solutions to complex business problems.
